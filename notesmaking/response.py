    "result": "A scheduler is a component of an operating system that selects processes from various scheduling queues for execution on the CPU. There are different types of schedulers, such as the long-term scheduler (job scheduler) and the short-term scheduler (CPU scheduler), each responsible for different aspects of process management and resource allocation. The scheduler plays a crucial role in determining which process gets to use the CPU at any given time.",

A process continues \nthis cycle until it terminates, at which time it is removed from all queues and \nhas its PCB and resources deallocated. \n3.2.2 Schedulers \nA process migrates among the various scheduling queues throughout its \nlifetime. The operating system must select, for scheduling purposes, processes \nfrom these queues in some fashion. The selection process is carried out by the \nappropriate scheduler. \nOften, in a batch system, more processes are submitted than can be executed \nimmediately. These processes are spooled to a mass-storage device (typically a \ndisk), where they are kept for later execution. The long-term scheduler, or job \nscheduler, selects processes from this pool and loads them into memory for \nexecution. The short-term scheduler, or CPU scheduler, selects from among \nthe processes that are ready to execute and allocates the CPU to one of them. \nThe primary distinction between these two schedulers lies in frequency \nof execution. The short-term scheduler must select a new process for the CPU \nfrequently. A process may execute for only a few milliseconds before waiting \nfor an I/0 request. Often, the short-term scheduler executes at least once every \n100 milliseconds. Because of the short time between executions, the short-term \nscheduler must be fast. If it takes 10 milliseconds to decide to execute a process \nfor 100 milliseconds, then 10 I (100 + 10) = 9 percent of the CPU is being used \n(wasted) simply for scheduling the work. \nThe long-term scheduler executes much less freqvently; minutes may sep\xad\narate the creation of one new process and the next. The long-term scheduler \ncontrols the degree of multiprogramming (the number of processes in mem\xad\nory). If the degree of multiprogramming is stable, then the average rate of \nprocess creation must be equal to the average departure rate of processes \nleaving the system. Thus, the long-term scheduler may need to be invoked",

Because of the longer interval between \nexecutions, the long-term scheduler can afford to take more tin<e to decide \nwhich process should be selected for execution. \nIt is important that the long-term scheduler make a careful selection. In \ngeneral, most processes can be described as either I/ 0 bound or CPU bound. An \nI/O-bound process is one that spends more of its time doing I/O than it spends \ndoing computations. A CPU-bound process, in contrast, generates I/0 requests \ninfrequently, using more of its time doing computations. It is important that the \nlong-term scheduler select a good process mix of I/O-bound and CPU-bound \nprocesses. If all processes are I/0 bound, the ready queue will almost always \nbe empty, and the short-term scheduler will have little to do. If all processes \nare CPU bound, the I/0 waiting queue will almost always be empty, devices \nwill go unused, and again the system will be unbalanced. The system with the \nbest performance will thus have a combination of CPU-bound and I/O-bound \nprocesses. \nOn some systems, the long-term scheduler may be absent or minimal. \nFor example, time-sharing systems such as UNIX and Microsoft Windows \nsystems often have no long-term scheduler but simply put every new process in \nmemory for the short-term scheduler. The stability of these systems depends \neither on a physical limitation (such as the number of available terminals) \nor on the self-adjusting nature of human users. If performance declines to \nm<acceptable levels on a multiuser system, some users will simply quit. \nSome operating systems, such as time-sharing systems, may introduce an \nadditional, intermediate level of scheduling. This medium-term scheduler is \ndiagrammed in Figure 3.8. The key idea behind a medium-term scheduler \nis that sometimes it can be advantageous to remove processes from mem\xad\nory (and from active contention for the CPU) and thus reduce the degree \nof multiprogramrning. Later, the process can be reintroduced into memory, \nand its execution can be continued where it left off. This scheme is called \nswapping. The process is swapped out, and is later swapped in, by the \nmedium-term scheduler. Swapping may be necessary to improve the pro\xad\ncess mix or because a change in memory requirements has overcommitted \navailable memory, requiring memory to be freed up.

The user cannot simultaneously type in characters and run the \nspell checker within the same process, for example. Many modern operatin.g \nsystems have extended the process concept to allow a process to have multiple \nthreads of execution and thus to perform more than one task at a time. On a \nsystem that supports threads, the PCB is expanded to include information for \neach thread. Other changes throughout the system are also needed to support \nthreads. Chapter 4 explores multithreaded processes in detail. \nThe objective of multiprogramming is to have some process nnming at all \ntimes, to maximize CPU utilization. The objective of time sharing is to switch the \nCPU among processes so frequently that users can interact with each program \nwhile it is run.ning. To meet these objectives, the process scheduler selects \nan available process (possibly from a set of several available processes) for \nprogram execution on the CPU. For a single-processor system, there will never \nbe more than one running process. If there are more processes, the rest will \nhave to wait until the CPU is free and can be rescheduled. \n3.2.1 Scheduling Queues \nAs processes enter the system, they are put into a job queue, which consists \nof all processes in the system.

When a process is allocated the \nCPU, it executes for a while and eventually quits, is interrupted, or waits for \nthe occurrence of a particular event, such as the completion of an I/0 request. \nSuppose the process makes an I/O request to a shared device, such as a disk. \nSince there are many processes in the system, the disk may be busy with the \nI/0 request of some other process. The process therefore may have to wait for \nthe disk. The list of processes waiting for a particular I/0 device is called a \ndevice queue. Each device has its own device queue (Figure 3.6). \nA common representation of process scheduling is a queueing diagram, \nsuch as that in Figure 3.7. Each rectangular box represents a queue. Two types \nof queues are present: the ready queue and a set of device queues. The circles \nrepresent the resources that serve the queues, and the arrows indicate the flow \nof processes in the system. \nA new process is initially put in the ready queue. It waits there until it is \nselected for execution, or is dispatched. Once the process is allocated the CPU \nand is executing, one of several events could occur: \nThe process could issue an I/0 request and then be placed in an I/0 queue. \nThe process could create a new subprocess and wait for the subprocess\'s \ntermination. \nThe process could be removed forcibly from the CPU, as a result of an \ninterrupt, and be put back in the ready queue.',
